This project is the result of many hours of ricing to make the perfect Xmonad setup

## Info
This configuration is based off [Axarva](https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0)s rice with quite a few alterations.

THIS CONFIGURATION IS FOR ARCH LINUX ONLY!!! (might work for arch-based systems but untested).

This rice is configured for dual monitors stacked vertically, However it should work with any layout as long as you are willing to configure the tint2conf to fix any graphical issues.


## Extra Packages

- Cava (Terminal Music Visualizer)

- zsh terminal with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and the [auto-suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugin.

- neofetch

- Librewolf (better firefox)

- *to be expanded*
